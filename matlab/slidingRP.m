    nACGBelow2, confMatrix, cont, rp, nACG] ...
    = slidingRP(spikeTimes, varargin)
% compute the metric for a single cluster in a recording
%
% Inputs:
% - spikeTimes, a vector of times in seconds
% - params, a struct which may contain: 
%   - contaminationThresh, the amount of contamination that will be
%   acceptable to pass the neuron, default 10 (%)
%   - confidenceThresh, the amount of confidence that will be required to
%   decide that a given contamination level is not breached, default 90 (%)
%   - recDur, recording duration in seconds, if not specified will be taken
%   as the max spike time - highly recommended to specify
%   - cont, a vector of contamination levels at which to test the neuron.
%   The computation can be accelerated by setting this to only a single
%   value (which would need to be contaminationThresh), but this will not
%   allow a useful estimate of the contamination level, i.e. the returned
%   variable 'confidence' will be correct but 'contamination' will not. 
%
%
% Outputs:
% - passTest, binary indicating whether the neuron's contamination level is
% below contaminationThresh with at least confidenceThresh level of
% confidence
% - confidence, the confidence that you have less than the threshold level
% of contamination
% - contamination, the minimum contamination for which you have at least
% the threshold level of confidence. A value of NaN indicates high
% contamination
% - timeOfLowestCont, the time at which best score happens
% - nACGBelow2, the number of spikes in the ACG below 2 ms, so you can
% check whether this is 0 for low firing rate neurons that have been
% rejected by the normal metric
% - for other outputs, see documentation of computeMatrix, as these are
% passed through from there.
